## Description

Crypto app is my second React project made to look simple and to easily use it.  
For that I have used **create-react-app** together with:

- **_`Ant Design`_** as UI library with several custom CSS code
- **_`RTK Query and Axios`_** as data fetching and caching tool
- **_`React ChartJS`_** as chart to show a plain and nice diagram for crypto coin single page
- **_`React Router Dom`_** for app navigation
- **_`Momentjs, Millify, HTML-React-parser`_** for human-readable date, time, numbers, text

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
